Covid-Tracking-App
Second year Computer Science project

Made using Java FX and JPA

The JavaFX acts as the frontend creating a UI which users can interact with

Users can add/remove/update there close contacts they have with people and store there information such as phone number and email

This data is then saved in a MySQL database using JPA which the user can view and modify using the JavaFX interface

Hope you enjoy!
